The UnitsC++ Library
--------------------

Please read the unitscpp.pdf file for an overview of the library and
why you might find it useful.

The library contains the following files:

    LICENSE             License under which the library is released
    README              This file
    area.cpp            Part of demo program
    demo.cfg            Part of demo program
    demo.cpp            Part of demo program
    gen.py              Script to generate library's include file
    makefile            GNU makefile to make demo and test programs
    test_constants.cpp  Part of unit test program
    test_units.cfg      Part of unit test program
    test_units.cpp      Part of unit test program
    unitscpp.pdf        Documentation

Once you understand how the library works, the only file you really
need is the gen.py script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the demo program
-------------------------

A working python installation is needed on your system.  You must have
a python version of 2.0 or later.

If you have a GNU-compatible make and g++, you can just use the
makefile to build the demo program and the tests by running make.

If you just want to compile from the command line, execute these commands:

    python gen.py demo.cfg
    cxx demo.cpp area.cpp

where cxx is the command for your C++ compiler.

To run the unit test
--------------------

The unit test is not intended to test every possible case; in particular,
the cases where the code SHOULDN'T compile are not tested thoroughly (in
fact, there's only one test case).

Here's how to build and run the tests

1.  Test for successful operations
    
    python gen.py test_units.cfg
    cxx -o test_units test_units.cpp
    test_units

    The test passes if there are no assert messages.
    Similarly, build and run test_constants.cpp.

2.  Test that the compiler detects a unit mismatch

    python gen.py test_units.cfg
    cxx -DWILLNOTCOMPILE -o test_units test_units.cpp

    You should get a compilation error.
